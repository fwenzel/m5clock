Shoutout to Jaap Meijers for this instructable:

and the code used here to generate the quotes in the right size for the m5 paper.

How to generate image files:
* place TTF files in this folder (I use [EB Garamond](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/EB+Garamond) regular and bold as well as [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/)).
* replace font names in `quote_to_image.php` as needed.
* run it: `./quote_to_image.php`
